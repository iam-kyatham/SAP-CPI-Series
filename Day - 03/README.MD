# Integration Suite
The SAP integration suite is a comprehensive(everything), cloud-based integration platform-as-a-service(iPaas) offered by SAP. It enables businesses to connect applications, data and processes across hybrid and heterogenous landscapes seamlessly. It is part of the SAP BTP and supports integration scenarios ranging from application-to-application (A2A) to business-to-business (B2B) and data integration.

# Package
Package is nothing but a container (or) folder, inside 1 package we can create 'n' no.of iflows (or) integration flows.

# Integration Flow
A integration flow in SAP CPI is essentially a design blueprint that orchestrates(arrange) the data movement and transformation between different systems, whether they are on-premises, in the cloud (or) hybrid.

# Tenants
Tenants are isolated environments within CPI that serve different purposes such as development, Testing and Production.

# Runtime Nodes
Runtime nodes are actual execution environments within a tenant where the iflows are processed. They handle the execution of integration scenarios, including data transformation, routing and communication with external systems.

# Pallet Functions
Pallet functions refer to the set of pre configured tools, icons, and integration artifacts available in the integration flow designer to help you design, build and manage integration scenarios. Easy drag and drop functionality.
